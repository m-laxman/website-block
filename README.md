# website-block 

facebook.com is blocked in this case, you can block any site using this.
The scenario here is, the site is blocked between 8 AM to 5PM(17 in 24hr format).
Once you start running the websiteblock.py as administrator, the program starts its execution.
The hosts file is edited to block sites. 
The hosts file is a computer file used in an operating system to map hostnames to IP addresses. The hosts file is a plain-text file and is traditionally named hosts.
For various reasons it may be necessary to update the hosts file on your computer to properly resolve a web site by its domain name. The most common reason for this is to allow people to view or publish web content immediately after purchasing a new domain name or transferring an existing domain name to another ISP (Internet Service Provider).
New and transferred domain names have a delay period that can be anywhere from a few hours to a few days. During this period of time the new or transferred domain information propagates around the internet, and is generally unavailable.

Please note: this work around is only valid on the computer/server on which the change was made. It will not make the web site available to anyone on the internet.
